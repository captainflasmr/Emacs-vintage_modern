* Overview

An Emacs configuration that seamlessly works across versions — from the vintage Emacs 23.1.1 (released in 2009) to the latest modern versions. Whether you're working on a legacy system or a cutting-edge setup, this configuration ensures consistency, usability, and stability across all supported versions of Emacs.

This project is perfect for:

- Developers maintaining software on older systems.
- Emacs enthusiasts who love stability but want modern tools.
- Anyone who wants a configuration that "just works" across decades of Emacs' history.

* Features

- Compatibility with Emacs versions ranging from *23.1.1* (Vintage) to the current *modern release*.
- Lightweight and modular, allowing users to selectively enable or disable features.
- Common quality-of-life enhancements like syntax highlighting, version control helpers, and some "modern niceties" when supported.
- Remains minimalist to support legacy systems with limited resources.
